# To-Do List Manager

## Overview
The To-Do List Manager is a console-based application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, remove completed tasks, and view their current list of tasks. The application utilizes classes to represent tasks and the to-do list, and it uses a vector from the STL to store the tasks. Additionally, the program reads from and writes to a file to persist the tasks between sessions.

## Purpose
The purpose of creating this software is to enhance my understanding of C++ programming, particularly in using object-oriented principles and the Standard Template Library (STL). This project serves as a practical application of these concepts.
